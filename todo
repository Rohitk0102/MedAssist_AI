Replace the current database setup with SQLite. Create a database file named `patients.db` and a table `patients` with the following columns:
- patient_id (integer, primary key)
- name (text)
- last_visit_date (date)
- visits_count (integer)

Generate 50 synthetic patient records with realistic names, random last_visit_date within the past 2 years, and visits_count between 1 and 5.  

The agent should provide functionality to:
1. Search EMR by patient name or ID.
2. Detect if a patient is new (visits_count = 1) or returning (visits_count > 1).
3. Return results in JSON format.
